The most important thing is architecture is more important than getting things done quickly. Plan your changes carefully before implementing them. Make sure that the architecture remains clean and extendable as the choices you make now will affect the future development of the project.

I hate venvs. Do not use them. Install all dependencies globally using pip and manage versions using requirements.txt.

Use python type hints for all functions and methods. This will help with code readability and maintainability.

When implementing new Engine connectors, dont use sleep statements to wait for the engine to make a move. Instead, implement proper waiting mechanisms that check the ui of the vintage game to see when it has made its move. This will make the connectors more reliable and efficient.
