# Accent Chess

We want to bring old chess computers back to life in this project. It will do this by providing a UCI interface to emulators of old chess computers. This way, you can play against the old chess computers using modern chess engines.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of two major parts. First, we have classes that know how to work with the emulators. Second, we have a UCI interface. The special sauce is the class that knows how to connect the two.

### Emulator Classes

These classes need to know the following things:

- How to start the emulator
- How to get into the game
- What the current game state is
- How to make a move
- How to create an arbitrary game state

They also need to know which UCI commands they can handle. Some engines cannot start from an arbitrary game state.

### UCI Interface

The UCI interface will handle the communication with the outside world. It will parse the commands and send them to the correct emulator. It will also need to know how to handle the responses from the emulators.

The UCI interface needs to soften the edges of the emulators. It can talk to the emulator classes to get things done. But it also needs to know what counts as thinking time and what counts as setup time. It can take some time to set up a game state. And it can take some time to make a move. But the UCI interface needs to know what is what.

## TODO

- [ ] Create the UCI interface
  - [ ] Understand the UCI protocol
  - [ ] Create a UCI parser
  - [ ] Create a base class for the emulators that can handle the UCI protocol
  - [ ] Create an I/O interface for the UCI interface
- [ ] Emulators
  - [ ] Create a framework for setting up emulators
    - [ ] The Internet Archive compatibility
    - [ ] DOSBox
    - [ ] GameBoy emulator
    - [ ] MAME
  - [ ] Create a prototype for one game
  - [ ] Create utilities
    - [ ] Image chessboard reader
    - [ ] Game state checker
    - [ ] Checking for valid moves

And while this is an impressive list of games, it is currently just a list. We need to determine which games we can emulate and which of these games we can actually play against.

## Thoughts

To make this project a success, it needs to be easily accessible. Controlling it with UCI is the most straightforward way to do this.

The challenge with the UCI protocol is that the game state is very fragile, and UCI can ask an engine to start from any game state.

To ensure we can accommodate this, we need to implement a more narrow version of the UCI protocol and error out when we cannot handle the request.
